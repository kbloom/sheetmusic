\chapter{Forward}

When I was planning my wedding, and looking to have a band play some 
Sephardic wedding songs, I discovered that one of the big roadblocks to 
to doing so is the lack of sheet music. The few books that are available 
focus on giving a view of Sephardic songs that come from many different 
Sephardic countries, and don't delve quite as deeply into the repertoire 
of songs that are familiar in Middle Eastern Sephardic synagogues as I 
would like. I therefore made it my business to learn to play some of 
these songs, and that meant transcribing them.

The music that I have included in this song book is music that I have 
learned at the Sephardic synagogues that I have attended on a regular 
basis, including:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Bar Yohai Sephardic Minyan in Sunnyvale, CA
   \item Ohel Shalom Torah Center in Chicago, IL
   \item Sephardic Congregation in Evanston, IL
   \item Sephardic Community of Greater Boston
\end{itemize}

We sing many of these songs on Shabbat and chagim at these shuls, others 
we know because we apply them to the tefillah on Shabbat. Others I've 
learned by looking on YouTube or pizmonim.org to find something that's 
in my song book and fills a particular thematic need. (In particular, 
I've tried to learn a variety of songs for each holiday to sing at meals 
with my family.) The words to these songs can be found in:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Abiaa Renanot
   \item Shir u'shbchah, Hallel v'zimrah -- The Syrian red book
   \item Shir u'shbchah by R' Moshe Batzri.
\end{itemize}

Velvel Pasternak is a giant in Jewish sheet music. The songs that he has 
transcribed span the gamut from Chassidic to Sephardic to modern 
Israeli. His books aim to cover a breadth of different Sephardic 
traditions and include many popular Middle Eastern Sephardic songs, but 
they don't delve as deeply into Middle Eastern music as I have here.
I have a couple of his Sephardic books and have tried to avoid 
duplicating any song that he has already included in the songbooks I 
own.
As a result, there are many songs in his Sephardic songbooks 
that we do sing in Middle Eastern Sephardic synagogues, including some 
of the more popular songs, so the reader is advised to look at his 
songbooks in addition to my own.

Rav Ovadia Yosef writes in Yechave Da'at 5:2 that the major principle of 
Sephardic music is found in the verse 
"\RL{על ערבים בתוכה תלינו כינורתינו}" (Tehillim 137:2), expressing that the 
Sephardic musical tradition is based on Arabic songs and Arabic scales (maqamat).
Some of the maqamat used in this book are  
are found in Western and European music, such as Ajam, Nahawand, and Hijaz. Some 
of the other scales, such as Saba and Sigah call for the musician to be able to 
play quarter tones. While I have not avoided songs written in these scales, I 
have focused on transcribing them in a way that sounds reasonably good on 
Western instruments, specifically on my trumpet, and therefore I have 
not notated quarter tones in my music, and instead chosen a note on the Western 
chromatic scale that works well enough in practice as a substitute.

I don't consider myself to be an expert in Arabic music, and there are certainly 
others in the shuls I frequent that have a broader knowledge of this genre than 
I do, but I hope that others will find these transcriptions helpful.

I have chosen the name \RL{ותקעתם בחצוצרות} to allude to the verse
\RL{וביום שמחתכם ובמועדיכם ובראשי חדשיכם ותקעתם בחצצרת על עלתיכם ועל זבחי שלמיכם והיו לכם לזכרון לפני אלקיכם אני ה' אלקיכם}
(Bemidbar 10:10), to refer to the songs for Shabbat, holidays, and other simchas 
that are in the book, and to allude to the trumpet that I play them on.
