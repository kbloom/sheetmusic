# Sephardic Pizmonim Sheet Music

This repository contains sheet music of Sephardic Pizmonim that are commonly
sung in the shuls I frequent (or have frequented in the past). These shuls include:

 * Ohel Shalom Torah Center in Chicago (Rabbi Daniel Raccah, and Hazzah Shimon
   Cohen)
 * Sephardic Community of Greater Boston (Rabbi Aharon Hamaoui)
 * Sephardic Congregation in Chicago (Rabbi Emeritus Michael Azose, Rabbi
   Hertzel Yitzhak, and Hazzan Moshe Shemer)

I want to extend a big thank you to everyone at these shuls who has taught me these songs.

There are other songs (some of them quite important) that we sing at these
shuls that aren't in this repository. This is because I own copies of a couple
of Sephardic song books by Velvel Pasternak, and I've opted not to
re-transcribe songs that can be found in the songbooks I already own.


# To do list

Songs I still want to transcribe:

 * Yifrach v'Yirbeh
 * Chai v'Nelam
 * Rayonai Yachid
 * Yedid Hashev et Shevuti
