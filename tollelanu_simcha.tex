\chapter{Forward}

When I was planning my wedding, and looking to have a band play some 
Sephardic wedding songs, I discovered that one of the big roadblocks to 
to doing so is the lack of sheet music. The few books that are available 
focus on giving a view of Sephardic songs that come from many different 
Sephardic countries, and don't delve quite as deeply into the repertoire 
of songs that are familiar in Middle Eastern Sephardic synagogues as I 
would like. I therefore made it my business to learn to play some of 
these songs, and that meant transcribing them.

The music that I have included in this song book is music that I have 
learned at the Sephardic synagogues that I have attended on a regular 
basis, including:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Bar Yohai Sephardic Minyan in Sunnyvale, CA
   \item Ohel Shalom Torah Center in Chicago, IL
   \item Sephardic Congregation in Evanston, IL
   \item Sephardic Community of Greater Boston
\end{itemize}

We sing many of these songs on Shabbat and chagim at these shuls, others 
we know because we apply them to the tefillah on Shabbat. Others I've 
learned by looking on YouTube or pizmonim.org to find something that's 
in my song book and fills a particular thematic need. (In particular, 
I've tried to learn a variety of songs for each holiday to sing at meals 
with my family.) The words to these songs can be found in:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Abiaa Renanot
   \item Shir u'shbchah, Hallel v'zimrah -- The Syrian red book
   \item Shir u'shbchah by R' Moshe Batzri.
\end{itemize}

Velvel Pasternak is a giant in Jewish sheet music. The songs that he has 
transcribed span the gamut from Chassidic to Sephardic to modern 
Israeli. His books aim to cover a breadth of different Sephardic 
traditions and include many popular Middle Eastern Sephardic songs, but 
they don't delve as deeply into Middle Eastern music as I have here.
I have a couple of his Sephardic books and have tried to avoid 
duplicating any song that he has already included in the songbooks I 
own.
As a result, there are many songs in his Sephardic songbooks 
that we do sing in Middle Eastern Sephardic synagogues, including some 
of the more popular songs, so the reader is advised to look at his 
songbooks in addition to my own.

Sephardic music is written in many different Arabic maqamat (scales), some of 
which are found in Western and European music, and some of which are not. 
Many of the scales which are not involve the use of 
quarter tones. I have not attempted to preserve these quarter tones in my 
transcriptions. Instead, I have focused on transcriptions that sound 
reasonably good on Western instruments, specifically on my trumpet.

I have chosen the name \RL{תוללנו שמחה} for this book because it is one 
of several expressions of song in Psalm 137. This is intended to hint at the verse
"\RL{על ערבים בתוכה תלינו כינורתינו}", also found in that psalm (v. 2), 
which is an expression of the major principle of Sephardic music (See 
Yechave Da'at 2:5) --- that many of our melodies are borrowed from 
Arabic songs.

I don't consider myself to be an expert in Arabic music, nor do I 
consider myself to have a particularly broad knowledge of this genre,
but I certainly hope that others will find these transcriptions helpful.
